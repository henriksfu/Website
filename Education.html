                I am currently studying Bachelors of Applied Science in Computing Science in <br>Simon Fraser '
                University, British Columbia. I am pretty new to the field of computing science, <br>so gathering 
                new experience every day. I am currently working on a language <br>learning web application as 
                a part of a project in my software engineering course (CMPT276).
                <br><br>
                I have some experience working with MySQL as it was a part of my academic curriculum in the <br>start
                of my second year. I am still learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in this semester. <br>Also, 
                as a keen interest, I am learning web development as it is quite useful in coming computer <br>industry.
